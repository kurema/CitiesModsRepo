# Cities:Skylines Mods for Epic users
Some mod developer publish GitHub Repo but don't have any GitHub Releases.
Now that [Steam Workshop Downloader](https://steamworkshopdownloader.io/) is dead, you have to build by yourself which is not very easy.

So this repo have some compiled results.
It's basically latest version as of 16 Sep 2022 and has not been updated since then. So it can be too old for you.

I do not maintain this repo anymore because I'm not playing Cities:Skylines right now.

[^1]: You have to add references.
[^2]: You should delete PostBuildEvent (and sometimes PreBuildEvent) to build successfully. Or update it to match your environment, in that case theres no need for [^8][^9][^10].
[^3]: Do not copy files that overlap with "CitiesSkylines/Cities_Data/Managed" folder.
[^4]: You should not copy "CitiesHarmony.Harmony.dll" and "CitiesHarmony.Harmony.xml" but do copy "CitiesHarmony.API.dll". You also have to add CitiesHarmony mod if you haven't.
[^5]: This mod can be used with other mod named "[UnifiedUI (UUI)](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2255219025)".
[^6]: This repo use OptionsFramework with Git submodule. If you download a zip file, you also have to download OptionsFramework and put it in the directory (in the way directory name matches).
[^7]: This repo use RedirectionFramework with Git submodule. If you download a zip file, you also have to download RedirectionFramework and put it in the directory.
[^8]: You have to copy "Locale" folder manually.
[^9]: You have to copy "Translations" folder manually.
[^10]: You have to copy "Resources" folder manually.
[^11]: PostBuildEvent is doing `pdb2mdb.exe` but you don't have to.
[^12]: Move all `*.crp` in sub directories to the mod directory (NetworkExtensions2). ``forfiles /P "bin/Release" /S /M *.CRP /C "cmd /c move @file \"bin/Release\""``
[^13]: Mod folder must be "NetworkExtensions2" and nothing else. Maybe it should be in `%LOCALAPPDATA%/Colossal Order/Cities_Skylines/Addons/Mods` not in `%programfiles%\Epic Games\CitiesSkylines\Files\Mods`. Read [this](https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/discussion/812125426/3995220924714723313/).
[^14]: The size of the repository is big. Don't forget to delete the directory and zip files after the build if it matters.
[^20]: Name of the mod is "Extra Landscaping Tools" but project name is "NaturalResourcesBrush". Never mind.
[^21]: Name of the mod is "81 Tiles" but repo name is "cities-skylines-unlimiter-1", and "EightyOne.csproj". I will not repeat this further.
[^22]: Files in "CitiesSkylines/Cities_Data/Managed" folder like ICities.dll and ColossalManaged.dll are in the [repository](https://github.com/andreharv/NetworkExtensions/tree/master/References). No comment.

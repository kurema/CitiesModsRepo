# Compatibility Issues of 1.15.0-f7
In the following are compatibility issues I encountered on 16 Sep 2022. It's likely to be fixed in a few days or weeks.

| Mod | Issue | Link |
| -- | -- | -- |
| 81 Tiles | The game shows error message.<br />You can not make a road in the new city.<br />You can't open the existing city even if mod is disabled. (?) | [Steam](https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/discussion/576327847/3435703754802635202/) |
| Extra Landscaping Tools | The game show error message. | |
| ~Intersection Marking Tool~ | ~The game says the mod is too old.[^1]~ | |
| ~Network Multitool~ | ~The game says the mod is too old.[^1]~ | |
| ~Node Controller Renewal~ | ~The game says the mod is too old.[^1]~ | |
| Improved Public Transport 2 | Looks like not working. | |

[^1]: ~The game says the mod is compatible with 1.15.0-f5, not 1.15.0-f7. But it's a minor update. You can just ignore.~ It's fixed next day.

With 81 Tiles and Extra Landscaping Tools disabled, I could succesfully start the new city. But it doesn't mean it works perfectly.

## Fixes
81 Tiles has a fork, [81 Tiles 2](https://github.com/algernon-A/EightyOne2).

Extra Landscaping Tools also has a [fixed version](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2862940316), but where's GitHub repo?

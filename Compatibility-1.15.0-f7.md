# Compatibility Issues of 1.15.0-f7
In the following are compatibility issues I encountered on 16 Sep 2022. It's likely to be fixed in a few days or weeks.

| Mod | Issue | Link |
| -- | -- | -- |
| 81 Tiles | The game shows error message.<br />You can not make a road in the new city.<br />You can't open the existing city even if mod is disabled. (?) | [Steam](https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/discussion/576327847/3435703754802635202/) |
| Extra Landscaping Tools | The game show error message. | |
| Intersection Marking Tool | The game says the mod is too old.[^1] | |
| Network Multitool | The game says the mod is too old.[^1] | |
| Node Controller Renewal | The game says the mod is too old.[^1] | |

[^1]: The game says the mod is compatible with 1.15.0-f5, not 1.15.0-f7. But it's a minor update. You can just ignore.

With 81 Tiles and Extra Landscaping Tools disabled, I could succesfully start the new city. But it doesn't mean it works perfectly.
